    - question: >-
        Calculated the expected relative increase (in percent) in
        $T_{MRCA}$ when adding an eleventh sample as compared to a
        sample size $n=10$. What implication does this have for the
        effect of sampling more sequences? Answer to two decimal
        places.
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: value
          correct: true
          value: 1.01
          feedback: >-
            Correct! The relative increase in percent is $(T11 -
            T10)/T10 * 100$. Adding more samples does not add
            substantially to the $T_{MRCA}$ when, say, $n>10$, but
            rather adds coalescent events close to the bottom of the
            tree. It is more important to add sites than samples to
            study genetic variation.

        total branch length of a coalescent tree, when time is
        expressed in units of 2N generations? Use the expression for
        $E(T_{total})$ above and answer to two decimal points. Compare

            Correct. The total branch length is calculated as

          feedback: >-
            Correct! There are two mutations on the branch from sample
            1 to its ancestor. Since there is no explicit ordering of
            mutations, any sequence with two derived states
            (two 1's) is correct.

            to its ancestor 6, followed by three on the branch from 6
            to the MRCA. Since we (arbitrarily) order mutations with

            (mutated_ts.tables.sites). In fact, all mutations are
            placed on site 0, for the simple reason that we still
